# Desktop Assistant ðŸ’»ðŸ¤–
This is a simple project which runs on your terminal which acts like an 
desktop assistant 

Once you start , it will greet you and will ask for what you want 
the available options currently are 

1.Wikipedia search

2.Current time and date

3.Opening google or youtube

I have a plan to make it into an app in the future
